# Introduction

The git "Quant-UX-Collection" is the git project I created for Quant UX Research methods. The git project includes the following commen methods in Quant UX Research:

1. Experimental Design (t-test, anova, chi-square, F-test, binomial benchmarking)
2. Special Experimental Design (non-normal distribution, possion distribution, Kruskalâ€“Wallis t-test )

3. Linear Regression and Non-Linear Regression
4. A/B Testing
5. Survey Data
6. Error Measurement
7. Satisfaction Rating
8. KeyPath and Sankey Diagram
9. Eyetracking 


Except these traditional Quant UX Research methods, the git project also includes other cutting edge methods that I feel may influence UX Research in future.

10. Social Science
11. Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality Quant UX (based on Unity)
12. Machine Learning (Conventional Neural Network and Reforcement Learning)

# Usage
The project does not provide basic algorithms and functions in quant data analysis but focus more on real applied use cases. The program code is mainly R and Python, but also includes some fundamental SQL and Tableau Language. All the packages can be installed directly from web link.
