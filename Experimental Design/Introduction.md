## Experimental Design In Quant UX Research

### Introduction

The classical statistic experimental design has been widely used in quant UX research. In a quantitative test, quant UX research is always in **proving somethings**. Therefore finding the p-value and significant level are the common methods in this case.

In this GitHub project, I will introduce some  basic coding in experimental design UX research, such as 

#### Basic Statistical Mode in R

t-test, 

ANOVA 

Chi-Square

Binomial Distribution

#### Is There a Statistical Difference between design?

Comparing Two Means (Rating Scales and Task Times)

Within-subjects Comparison (Paired t-test)

Comparing Task Time (**related to VR/AR UX research**)

Between-subjects comparison (Two-sample t-test)

#### Upgrade

Comparing Completion Rates

Conversion Rates

A/B Testing
