## Introduction

The webpage linear regression analysis is the project I did in Siemens. The linear regression model is to predict website page design aesthetics (user's first impression to the website design)

The model is based on Prof.Renecke's ACM CHI paper in 2013. It uses colorfulness and complexity as two main factors and user's gender, age, education level as human factors to predict user's webpage design rating.

Except using linear regression model, our research also use Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Conventional Neural Network (CNN) to let computer learn human psychology behavior as well. After been trained by 300 pictures, the CNN model could predict user's rating almost correctly (exceed 89%). These details will be mentioned in "Machine Learning UX Research Project"
