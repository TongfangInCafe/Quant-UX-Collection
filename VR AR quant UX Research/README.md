## Introduction 

The folder includes three projects that I did related to AR & VR:

- Google Glass AR (My paper published in ACM CHI 2015)
- Mobile AR (University of Washington, research project)
- VR Unity Research (HCDE 517 HTC Vive Project)




## Four Principles in VR UX Research

- Participant motion and direction. VR users may move their heads and limbs in different directions, as well as walk around a small space. Designers need to validate that their software designs are not forcing users into uncomfortable or potentially injurious body positions and movements.
- Interaction between physical and virtual worlds. Ultimately users in VR interact with virtual objects and spaces. If a VR software application has virtual movement enabled through physical movement, then at a certain point there will be a disconnect between the physical and virtual space. How the software handles this difference has a large impact on the feeling of presence (the feeling of being within the environment) the user feels while using the software.
- Physiological response. Individuals can feel sick or have balance issues while in a virtual environment because there is a disconnect between interactions in the virtual environment and movement in the real world. Testing can reveal what elements of a VR program lead to uncomfortable physiological responses.
- Hardware comfort. VR involves the use of many pieces of equipment: headsets, unfamiliar controllers, and wires that may lead to user discomfort. Comfort level for these devices should be assessed for both short- and long-term use.



## Methods

The quant UX researches are conducted by competitive analysis or eye tracking technology area of interest (AOI). The following methods can be found in "Quant UX Research"

#### Competitive Analysis

T-Test

ANOVA

Linear Regression

Kruskal Wallis One-way ANOVA

#### Eye Tracking

Unity R
